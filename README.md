# Student Score Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project predicts the **mean score** of students using their **math, reading, and writing scores** along with demographic information. It is implemented using **Logistic Regression** and demonstrates **data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation**.

## Objective
- Explore student performance data.
- Learn how **categorical features** can be encoded for modeling.
- Visualize patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- Train and evaluate a **Logistic Regression model** for predictive analysis.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains student scores and demographic features:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental level of education
  - Lunch type
  - Test preparation course
  - Math score
  - Reading score
  - Writing score
- **Target:** `mean score` (average of math, reading, and writing scores)  

> Note: This project is a **learning exercise** using publicly available student score datasets to understand Logistic Regression and data analysis.  

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Label encoding for categorical variables.
- **Visualization:** Countplots, pairplots, heatmaps.
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression for predicting mean scores.
- **Evaluation:** Comparing predicted vs actual scores to analyze model performance.
