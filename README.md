# Student Score Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project predicts the **mean score** of students based on their **math, reading, writing scores** and demographic information using **Logistic Regression**. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

- Features include:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental level of education
  - Lunch
  - Test preparation course
  - Math score
  - Reading score
  - Writing score
- Target: `mean score` (average of math, reading, and writing scores)

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Label encoding for categorical features.
- **Visualization:** Countplots, pairplots, and heatmaps.
- **Model:** Logistic Regression to predict mean scores.
- **Evaluation:** Error analysis using difference between predicted and actual scores.
